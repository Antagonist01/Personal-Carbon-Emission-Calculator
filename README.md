# Personal-Carbon-Emission-Calculator
# 🌍 Personal Carbon Calculator

It is an interactive Streamlit app that estimates your annual CO₂ footprint based on daily commute, electricity use, waste generation, and diet.  
It adapts units automatically for India, the USA, or the UK and shows a clear category breakdown (Transport, Electricity, Diet, Waste).  
Eco-badges (Gold, Silver, Bronze) reward low emissions, while real-world equivalents (flights, driving, trees) bring your impact into perspective.  
Actionable offsetting tips and a persistent Emission History table help you track progress and reduce your carbon footprint over time.
